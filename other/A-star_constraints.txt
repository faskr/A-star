NOTE: A* works because it uses minimum cost so far and minimum possible remaining cost to
efficiently choose the best candidates for an optimal path, and to discard them when they
begin to have worse potential than others, instead of blindly choosing paths equally. If
the heuristic estimates a remaining cost that is more than the minimum possible, any paths
that diminish the high estimates in favor of low real costs are cheaper and win out, which
causes blocks closer to the goal to be eaten up so quickly that alternative routes that
curve around, and are longer but cheaper, don't get considered before the goal is reached.
Therefore, costs must not be smaller than the heuristic between any two points, i.e. they
must be >= 1.
